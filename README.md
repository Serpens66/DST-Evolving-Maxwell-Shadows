# DST-Evolving-Maxwell-Shadows
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1868560353

This github upload contains a feature that is not currently live on steamworkshop.
I replaced the "Decay" of the shadows by hunger. So the shadows will starve if not feeded nightmarefuel.

One problem is, that the action feeding and putting sth into the shadows container dont work together. I would need to change alot of stuff to make them work together)
So I decided to remove the ability to store nightmarefuel in their containers.
But the current level system relies on putting fuel into the containers, that is why I did not upload this decay/hunger code yet.
I planned to replace the levelsystem by another mechanic discussed at the steam discussion, but really had no motivation to do so, because I dont feel we found that great solution for a good level system.

I wont have the time to complete this within the next months, that is why I simply upload it unfinished here.

Any modder fell free to complete it, but of course dont steal the code. Send me the completed code and I will upload it and may add you to the authors.
